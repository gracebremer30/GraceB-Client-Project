        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>What started as a weekend farmers market stand has grown into something sweet! Maddie's Muffin Shop was born out of a mother daughter tradition -- creating fun, flavorful muffins. After years of selling out locally in Key Largo, Maddie is thrilled to open her first storefront this summer. Whether you're grabbing breakfast on the go or treating yourself to something special, we've got the muffin for you!</p>
